# Cardiowave

Overview

Project Cardiowave is an innovative web-based application designed to visualize a 3D model of the human heart in response to ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Users can upload their ECG reports to the website and observe how the atria and ventricles of the heart model pump in accordance with the uploaded ECG data. This project leverages the power of Three.js techniques to bring a dynamic, interactive experience to understanding heart functions.
