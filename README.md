# Cardiowave

## Overview

Project Cardiowave is an innovative web-based application designed to visualize a 3D model of the human heart in response to ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Users can upload their ECG reports to the website and observe how the atria and ventricles of the heart model pump in accordance with the uploaded ECG data. This project leverages the power of Three.js techniques to bring a dynamic, interactive experience to understanding heart functions.

## Features

-> 3D Heart Visualization: Utilizes Three.js for rendering a detailed 3D model of the human heart.
-> ECG Data Interpretation: Converts ECG report data into visual movements of the heart model.
-> Real-time Interaction: Users can interact with the model, exploring different views and aspects of the heart's movement.
-> Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.


## How It Works

Upload ECG Report: Users upload their ECG report through the web interface.
Data Processing: The uploaded ECG data is processed to synchronize with the heart model's movements.
Visualization: The 3D heart model visualizes the pumping action of atria and ventricles based on the processed ECG data.


## Installation

This project does not require a traditional npm installation process. To get started:

Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a modern web browser to run the application.


## Usage

Drag and drop your ECG report onto the designated area in the web application.
The browser will then display the 3D heart model, showing the pumping action in sync with the ECG report data.
Interact with the model to explore different perspectives and details of the heart's movement.
